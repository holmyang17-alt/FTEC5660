# FTEC5660 Homework 1: Receipt Chain

Build a LangChain pipeline that reads every supermarket receipt in a folder
with the vision-capable DeepSeek Flash model and answers these two questions:

1. How much money did I spend in total for these bills?
2. How much would I have had to pay without the discount?

For this homework, **amount spent** means the final payment after the receipt's
rounding line. **Without the discount** means the sum of the original positive
item prices: add back every promotion, coupon, member, app, packaging-damage,
and percentage discount, but do not add back rounding.

## Student task

Only edit the two functions in `hw1.py` that contain `### YOUR CODE HERE`:

- `build_chain()` creates your LangChain chain.
- `answer_queries()` runs the chain on the receipt images and returns one final
  response for each question.

You may use prompt chaining, routing, parallel calls, reflection, or a
combination. Your final responses should each contain one HKD amount. Do not
hard-code filenames or public answers; grading uses unseen receipt folders.

## Setup and public test

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Put your DeepSeek key after `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=` in `.env`, then run:

```bash
python3 hw1.py --image-folder public_test
```

The program creates `results.csv` in the current directory. Its columns are
`query`, `model_response`, and `correctness`. The public answers are in
`public_test/ground_truth.json`. The starter intentionally returns the dummy
response `please design your chain to answer these two queries.` so it runs
before you add any API code.

The required model is `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp`, the vision-capable
DeepSeek Flash model. JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP inputs are accepted by the
homework runner.


## Homework 1 solution:

### Chain design

Receipt images
     |
     v
image_data_url()  ->  base64 data URL
     |
     v
ChatPromptTemplate (system + human with image_url)
     |
     v
ChatDeepSeek (deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp, temperature=0)
     |
     v
JSON: {pre_discount_total, final_payment}
     |
     v
Majority vote (3 per image)
     |
     v
Sum across all receipts
     |
     v
{QUERY_1: "HK$...", QUERY_2: "HK$..."}

### Description

My chain uses one vision-language model call per receipt. Each image is encoded
as a base64 data URL by image_data_url() and passed to a ChatPromptTemplate
whose human message contains a text instruction and an image_url block. The
system prompt asks the model to return only a JSON object with two keys:
pre_discount_total (SUBTOTAL plus all discounts added back, excluding ROUNDING)
and final_payment (the amount actually charged after ROUNDING). The prompt is
bound to ChatDeepSeek with model deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp and
temperature=0. Because a single pass is occasionally off by one line on
cluttered receipts, each image is queried three times and the most frequent
answer is kept. The per-receipt values are summed across the folder, and the
two totals are returned as QUERY_1 and QUERY_2 with exactly one HKD amount
each. On the public receipts this gives HK$1974.30 and HK$2348.20, matching
ground_truth.json.
